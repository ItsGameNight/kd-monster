/*

GUI Components

For convenient importing!

These components are intended to be reusable GUI and input
objects throughout the application. As such, they do not handle
updating the datastore directly, but each instead emits an update
event with the new value of the input as a payload. It is up to
the component using the input to implement the actual updating
of the datastore.
